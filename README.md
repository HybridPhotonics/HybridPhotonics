- 👋 Hi, we are the @HybridPhotonics research labs, made up of researchers at the University of Southampton and Skoltech
- 👀 We're interested in the dynamics of polariton condensates and their applications
- 🌱 We're currently learning about polariton condensates vortices, analog computing, analysis with ML and topological insulators
- 💞️ We're looking to collaborate on analog computing platforms, and their real-world applications
- 📫 We can be reached via our research group leader, Prof. Pavlos Lagoudakis: pavlos.lagoudakis@soton.ac.uk
- 🔗 Connect with us and keep up to date with our activities through our website, [polaritonics.org](https://www.polaritonics.org/home)
